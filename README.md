========

A small, lightweight, RFID tagin system for a gym.

Hardware used
-------------

* Raspberry Pi
* power supply for the Raspberry Pi (a regular micro USB cellphone charger will do)
* SparkFun RFID starter kit
* PiUPS
* USB to mini USB cable
* A big bag of 125Khz RFID tags (you don't really need this but I bought it)
* A plastic container for the Raspberry Pi (again, not essential but still nice to have)
* A GPIO length extender (so I can put the raspberry in the box and still connect the PiUPS, you probably don't really need this)

Modules used
------------

* requests
* pyserial
* flask
